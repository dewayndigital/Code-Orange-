Key Components:
HTML Structure:

Title: The page is titled "Code Orange Alert."
Container: A div with the ID fractalBitcoin serves as the container for the fractal pattern.
CSS Styling:

The body has a dark background (#282c34) for contrast against the golden Bitcoin symbols.
The fractal container is centered both horizontally and vertically, and the Bitcoin symbols are styled with a gold color and a monospaced font.
JavaScript Functionality:

Fractal Generation: The function createBitcoinSymbol recursively creates a fractal pattern by positioning smaller Bitcoin symbols at each corner of the previous symbol.
GSAP Animations: The Bitcoin symbols rotate, scale, and change color in a continuous loop, creating a dynamic visual effect using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).
Summary:
The code creates an animated fractal pattern of Bitcoin symbols on a web page, featuring rotating, scaling, and color-changing animations. The design is centered around the visual impact, making the page an engaging display of Bitcoin-related imagery without additional blockchain data.
